Things to do on Tuesday:

1. Find out why event listeners don't work on instances of Dancer
2. Move "Moveit()" function from init.js into the prototype for ZigZag
3. Move the variables that MoveIt is dependent on into each instance, make them part of the constructor (with an underscore). Those variables are "time", "x", and "y".
4. Work out how to invoke init.js on only certain instances
  (Find out interplay of variables between constructors and anything inside document.ready)
5. Replace solid blocks of color with an image or something
6. Consider each instance's awareness of others.

7. Make a keyboard-controlled dancer that repels other dancers. (Solid)
